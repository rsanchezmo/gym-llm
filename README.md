# Gym LLM
The purpose of this repository is to build an LLM-powered agent that interacts with an environment by reflecting on its previous observations and actions. LLMs ability to plan and reflect on complex environments can be tested. The LLM agent can also be used to compare against a traditional deep reinforcement learning agent.
