# Gym LLM
The purpose of this repository is to facilitate the deployment of LLM-powered agents that interacts with `gymnasium` environments by reflecting on its previous observations and actions.
The agents can be powered by `OpenAI` models or any local model that is integrated in `Ollama`. 

The library offers:
- `LLMWrapper`: A wrapper for `gymnasium` environments so you define the minimum requirements for the agent to interact with the environment: observation schema and goal description.
- `Agent`: An agent class to ask for actions based on the previous observations and actions.

## Installation
